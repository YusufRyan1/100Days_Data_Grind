# Day 4 – SQL Advanced Queries & Joins

Today I focused on mastering SQL joins, subqueries, aggregates, and DML commands:

- Practiced INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER, and SELF joins.
- Used anti-joins to find missing relationships.
- Applied GROUP BY with HAVING to filter aggregate results.
- Executed conditional UPDATE and DELETE commands.
- Reinforced foreign keys and referential integrity concepts.
