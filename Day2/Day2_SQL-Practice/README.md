Day 2 – SQL (DDL, DML, WHERE, JOINS)

Today was all about building the foundations of relational databases.
I covered the core SQL topics that every data analyst / data scientist must master before moving into advanced querying or database design.

🔹 What I Learned Today
1️⃣ DDL – Data Definition Language

I practiced how to create, modify, and remove database structures:

-CREATE TABLE

-ALTER TABLE (add/modify/drop columns)

-DROP

2️⃣ DML – Data Manipulation Language

How to manipulate the actual data:

-INSERT

-UPDATE

-DELETE

3️⃣ WHERE Conditions

Filtering data with:

-Comparison operators

-BETWEEN

-LIKE

-Date filtering

4️⃣ JOINS (Core Skill!)

I learned how tables connect together:

-INNER JOIN

-LEFT JOIN

(Used FULL JOIN for aggregation)

This is one of the most important skills in SQL, especially for data analytics and real-world business queries.

🧪 Tasks I Completed

-Created two tables (employee, departments)

-Inserted multiple records

-Practiced updating & deleting rows

-Applied filtering with WHERE

-Connected tables with JOINs

-Calculated aggregated salary metrics grouped by department
