# Day 3 – 100_DAYS_DATA_GRIND

## Python Block

Today I focused on **functions, error handling, and mini-project logic**.  

### Topics Covered
- Defining and calling **functions**
- **Positional arguments** and function parameters
- **Try / Except** blocks for handling errors
- **Mini-project**: Grocery System (Add / Remove / View items)
- Practiced data structures inside functions (lists, dictionaries)
- Implemented a small challenge: finding the first duplicate in a list

### Key Learnings
- Functions make code modular and reusable
- Error handling prevents crashes and improves user experience
- Using dictionaries and lists together allows building mini-databases
- Loops + functions + conditions can simulate real-life mini-systems

### Output / Exercises
- Created a list of 100 random numbers and calculated max, min, average, even/odd counts
- Simulated a **student database** using dictionaries, filtered and sorted data
- Built a **Grocery System** allowing users to add, remove, and view items
- Solved a **first-duplicate-in-list challenge**

### Notes
- Strong focus on **hands-on coding** and building functional mini-projects
- Prepared me for combining Python logic with real-world data operations
