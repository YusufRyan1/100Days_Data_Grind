# Day 5 – Python for Data Analysis (Pandas)

Today I started using Pandas for real data analysis.

What I practiced:
- Loading real CSV datasets with pandas
- Exploring data structure with .head(), .info(), .describe()
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Performing data analysis using groupby() and value_counts()
- Creating a country-based recommendation function

Key insights from the dataset:
- Identified the most common content type (Movies vs TV Shows)
- Found the top contributing countries
- Analyzed release year trends
- Calculated average durations and most common ratings
