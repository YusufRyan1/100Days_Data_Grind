Day 1 – 100_DAYS_DATA_GRIND
Today I practiced Python basics: variables, input/output, data types, conditional statements, and simple arithmetic operations.
I wrote small scripts to:

- Check if a number is even or odd

- Check if a number is positive or negative

- Build a simple calculator

- Compare two numbers

- Greet a user with their name and age

It may seem simple, but Rome wasn’t built in a day — building a strong foundation takes patience and practice.
